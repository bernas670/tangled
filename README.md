# TODOs
 - highlight knowledge row/col ?
 - revise backspace logic
 - add mouse controls to desktop instructions
 - add feedback when a word is completed (not just when you guess the word, could be completed while guessing another word)
 - mobile version:
    - knowledge cells are too large and only stay in one row or col
    - add feedback to keyboard (change color on click/vibrate if supported maybe)
 - ui not working in mdpi laptop
 - animations:
    - for individual cell when correct
    - for entire guessed word
    - for word that gets completed but not selected
    - for completed puzzled (something like a water drop, from middle to edges. or maybe have a library of different possibe animations)
