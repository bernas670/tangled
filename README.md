# TODOs
 - highlight knowledge row/col ?
 - revise backspace logic
 - add legend for colors
 - add instructions/rules
 - add feedback when a word is completed (not just when you guess the word, could be completed while guessing another word)
 - mobile version:
    - light/dark mode is taking up useful space
    - knowledge cells are too large and only stay in one row or col
    - add feedback to keyboard (change color on click/vibrate if supported maybe)
